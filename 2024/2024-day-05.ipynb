    "- ✅ You adapted your approach based on our discussion (direct rule checking vs. transitive closure)\n",

    "- ✅ Caught the global variable bug yourself and fixed it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas to consider for improvement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code clarity**: Your variable names like `t_s`, `p_u`, `r_item` are abbreviated. While fine for quick solving, would `total_sum`, `page_update`, `remaining_item` make it easier to read later?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency opportunity**: You're checking every pair in sequence and breaking early on violation (good!). But you're creating a list `check_rev_rules` even though you only need to know if *any* violation exists. Could you short-circuit even earlier?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge case thinking**: What happens if an update has an even number of pages? Your `int(len(p_u)/2)` works, but have you verified the middle index logic?\n",

    "Excellent question! This gets at a key property of topological sorting.\n",

    "When two nodes have no ordering relationship (no edge between them), topological sort considers them **independent**. The algorithm will produce *some* valid ordering, but there are multiple correct answers.\n",
