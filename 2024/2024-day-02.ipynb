You offer to help with the unusual data.\n",

    "Great work, Tom! You successfully solved Part 2 using NumPy. Here's my review:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you did well:**\n",
    "- You started with a clear function structure (`safe_with_dampener`) and tested it incrementally\n",
    "- You reused your existing `safe_report2` function effectively\n",
    "- You implemented the brute-force approach cleanly - trying each removal systematically\n",
    "- You tested on example data before running on the full dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas for improvement:**\n",
    "- **Sub-problem identification**: You jumped into coding fairly quickly. Did you explicitly write out the sub-problems before coding, or did they emerge as you went?\n",
    "- **Edge case thinking**: Before coding, did you consider: \"What if a report is already safe?\" (You handled this, but was it planned upfront?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for reflection:**\n",

    "good feedback! I was stuck on sub-problem identification - should I use brute-force method (which I don't like as it potentially may cost time), or evaluate the report whether it fits to tolerate a single bad level. Then, I asked solveit on guidance; for 'edge case thinking', I thought about it, and iterate the method to check it first using `safe_report2`. \n",

    "For small inputs (like ~1000 reports with ~8 levels each), brute force is totally fine. If it were 1 million reports, then you'd optimize.\n",

    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Incremental testing**: You tested on single examples before scaling up - this is excellent practice\n",
    "- **Code reuse**: You built on `safe_report` to create `safe_report2`, then reused it in Part 2\n",
    "- **Iteration**: You refined your approach based on feedback (NumPy version, edge cases)\n",
    "- **Tool selection**: You successfully applied NumPy to make your code more concise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas to develop:**\n",
    "- **Upfront planning**: Write out sub-problems as a checklist before coding - this helps you see the full picture\n",
    "- **Decision framework**: When facing efficiency trade-offs, estimate costs before getting stuck\n",
    "- **Test-driven start**: For Part 2, you could have written test cases for the examples first, then built the solution\n",
