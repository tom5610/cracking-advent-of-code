For example, if you have a function that extracts top-left to bottom-right diagonals, what could you do to the matrix to make that same function extract the other diagonal direction?"

I would scan the diagonal lines with 2 dimensions: row-based and column-based scanning. e.g. with a (n, m) matrix, when doing row-based scanning, I loop rows from 0 - (n - 4) (e.g. 4 is the length of 'XMAS'), then iterate column from 0 - m, so as to collect the line; when doing column-based scanning, I loop columns from 1 - (m - 4) (the column 0 has been scanned in the former one), then iterate row from 0 - n, so as to collect the line.
