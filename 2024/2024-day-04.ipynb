    "Excellent work, Tom! You solved it successfully. Here's my feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you did really well:**\n",
    "- **Systematic approach**: You broke the problem into clear steps (rows, columns, diagonals) and tackled them one at a time\n",
    "- **Test-driven**: You set up the test with example data early, which helped verify your logic incrementally\n",
    "- **Clean abstractions**: Your functions like `get_d_line()` and `get_d_lines()` are well-structured and reusable\n",
    "- **Pattern matching strategy**: Searching for both 'XMAS' and 'SAMX' to avoid bidirectional scanning was smart\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas to consider:**\n",
    "- **The flip**: Your `flip_h_matrix()` returns strings instead of keeping the matrix as lists of characters. This works, but it's a bit inconsistent with your original matrix structure. Did you notice `get_d_lines()` still worked because string indexing works the same way?\n",
    "- **Code organization**: You have some repeated logic (like converting matrix to strings). You could potentially consolidate the line collection into a single function that returns all lines at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for you:** Looking back, which part was trickiest? The diagonal extraction logic, or something else?"

    "np.diag(mx_np, k=-1)\n",
    "np.diag(mx_np, k=-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 10×10 matrix, you'd loop through offsets from `-(rows-1)` to `(cols-1)` to get all diagonals in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the other diagonal direction, you'd flip the matrix with `np.fliplr(mx_np)` and repeat.\n",

    "Great approach! Your method of using 3×3 sub-matrices and checking the X pattern is solid. A few thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your plan looks good overall.** The key insight is that you need to check if the diagonals of each 3×3 block form \"MAS\" or \"SAM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to refine your thinking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Valid X patterns**: How many valid 3×3 patterns are there? Each diagonal can be either \"MAS\" or \"SAM\", so that's 2×2 = 4 possible valid patterns, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extraction**: For extracting 3×3 sub-matrices from an n×m matrix, how many will you get? Think about the starting positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison strategy**: You mentioned comparing \"X related elements\" - are you planning to create 4 target matrices to compare against, or is there a simpler way to just check the two diagonals?\n",
    "\n",

    "**What you did really well:**\n",
    "- **Quick adaptation**: You immediately recognized the simpler diagonal-checking approach when I suggested it, rather than sticking to your original matrix comparison idea\n",
    "- **Incremental testing**: You tested the diagonal extraction on a single sub-matrix first before looping through all of them - smart debugging strategy\n",
    "- **Clean lambda**: Using `x_mas_match` as a lambda made the condition very readable\n",
    "- **Correct logic**: Checking **both** diagonals with `and` was the key insight - many people might mistakenly use `or`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small refinement opportunity:**\n",
    "- Your `count_x_mas` function takes a matrix directly, but earlier functions took raw `input_data` strings. For consistency, you might want to either convert inside the function or outside - though what you have works fine!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall**: You solved both parts efficiently and showed good problem-solving instincts. The NumPy approach made Part 2 much cleaner than it would've been with pure Python lists.\n",
