    "I created this repository to practice [SolveIt](https://solve.it.com/) method, and wanted to focus on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problem solving. With each notebook, I captured my problem solving experience, with which AI review and feedback, it helped me learn from my mistakes and sharpen my thought process. \n",

    "Day 2 problem is about numer extraction and practicing more concise way to tackle the problem. I learned how to break down the problem into sub problems; writing down the problem solving instructions before coding, and need to practice more test-driven development.\n",

    "\n",
    "Day 3 problem is about pattern matching problem! (yay, identifying the problem type is step one on problem solving.) I started from Python native methods and created a complex solution, which caused many troubles. However, when switching to Regex, I learned how to tackle the problem in a much clean and effective way - pattern matching! I really enjoyed it.\n",

    "Day 4 is a pattern match problem in a 2D space. It started with a string matching (XMAS) in 8 directions, then the part 2 focused on (X-MAS), to match a 2D shape in a 2D space. I took them as pattern match problems, and focus on improving the solution with concise and simple solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat is that I need to improve my test-driven development; don't just create a test method, and drop in afterwards; in addition, breakdown to sub-problems, and small parts, then verified them one by one.\n",
