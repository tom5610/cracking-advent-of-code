    "## Why this one?\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's not because of `42`, the ultimate answer by Deep Thought. \n",
    "\n",
    "I created this repository to practice [SolveIt](https://solve.it.com/) method, and wanted to focus on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problem solving. With each notebook, I captured my problem solving experience, with which AI review and feedback, it helped me learn from my mistakes and sharpen my thought process. \n",

    "> this one is purely a copy from SolveIt course 2025 lesson 1; having said that, I learned some via typing each cell.\n",

    "### 2024 - Day 02\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 2 problem is about numer extraction and practicing more concise way to tackle the problem. I learned how to break down the problem into sub problems; writing down the problem solving instructions before coding, and need to practice more test-driven development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2024 - Day 03\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 3 problem is about pattern matching problem! (yay, identifying the problem type is step one on problem solving.) I started from Python native methods and created a complex solution, which caused many troubles. However, when switching to Regex, I learned how to tackle the problem in a much clean and effective way - pattern matching! I really enjoyed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that, I practiced test-driven development, and taking 2-3 mins writing down my problem solving steps, and reviewed with AI & iteratively improve my solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "I need to: think about edge cases and defining the boundary; does order matter? identifying the problem type!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- In AI era, how I may use AI to solve problems? \n",
