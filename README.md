## Why this one?

> It's not because of `42`, the ultimate answer by Deep Thought. 

I created this repository to practice [SolveIt](https://solve.it.com/) method, and wanted to focus on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problem solving. With each notebook, I captured my problem solving experience, with which AI review and feedback, it helped me learn from my mistakes and sharpen my thought process. 

## Highlights

### 2024 - Day 01

> this one is purely a copy from SolveIt course 2025 lesson 1; having said that, I learned some via typing each cell.

### 2024 - Day 02

Day 2 problem is about numer extraction and practicing more concise way to tackle the problem. I learned how to break down the problem into sub problems; writing down the problem solving instructions before coding, and need to practice more test-driven development.

### 2024 - Day 03

Day 3 problem is about pattern matching problem! (yay, identifying the problem type is step one on problem solving.) I started from Python native methods and created a complex solution, which caused many troubles. However, when switching to Regex, I learned how to tackle the problem in a much clean and effective way - pattern matching! I really enjoyed it.

Other than that, I practiced test-driven development, and taking 2-3 mins writing down my problem solving steps, and reviewed with AI & iteratively improve my solution. 

I need to: think about edge cases and defining the boundary; does order matter? identifying the problem type!



#### 2024 - Day 04 (date: 5 Jan 2026)

Day 4 is a pattern match problem in a 2D space. It started with a string matching (XMAS) in 8 directions, then the part 2 focused on (X-MAS), to match a 2D shape in a 2D space. I took them as pattern match problems, and focus on improving the solution with concise and simple solutions. 

One caveat is that I need to improve my test-driven development; don't just create a test method, and drop in afterwards; in addition, breakdown to sub-problems, and small parts, then verified them one by one.

Learned 2 things: proactively think and get solveit's coaching - writing down the problem solving method & plan, then ask solveit to review so as to refine my method and plan; asking help to improve and brainstorm alternative solutions. 

> I may slow down my 'Advent of Code' 2024 journey, and work on a PoC with FastHTML, and LLMs. At least, I will try to do 1 problem a week. 

#### 2024 - Day 05 (date: 12 Jan 2026)

Day 5 is about number ordering problem. I really enjoy the coding experience on solveit, with interactive brainstorming process on problem solving, then coaching my coding and resolution. Especially, it's not about the answer(s), but the active thinking and quest to problem solving process. 

What I did well? I got a good sense to setup test harness and proceed step by step problem solving process. 

What I should improve? It took me long period to accomplish the whole, and I spent too much time on thinking a 'right' solution. I should do maximum 10mins, then start discussing with solveit on my methods. Be active thinking, and incrementally solving problems.
